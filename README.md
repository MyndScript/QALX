# QALX

Quantum-secure, emotionally tuned cryptography and mesh logic.

## Vision
Security as Empathy. Quantum-Resilient. Emotionally Tuned.

QALX is a living, ethically aware security organism. It combines quantum-resistant cryptography, emotional modulation (LYRA), and mesh network propagation to create proactive, multidimensional security.

## Features
- Quantum-secure key generation
- LYRA glyph modulation
- Mesh network propagation and validation
- Ethical revocation and stewardship

## How It Works
QALX is modular:
- `core/qalx.go`: Core types and metric initializers
- `core/lyra.go`: LYRA glyph logic and harmonics
- `core/mesh.go`: Mesh node/network logic and validation
- `core/entropy.go`: Entropy pool, key generation, and QRE security

## Quantum Resistance Entropy (QRE)
QRE is the heart of QALX’s quantum security. It combines classical and quantum metrics with emotional glyph modulation:

**QRE Formula:**

	 QRE = log₂(Eₛ × Pₚ × Φₕ × Ψₑ)

- **Eₛ**: Entropy spread across keyspace (Grover resistance)
- **Pₚ**: Period obfuscation factor (Shor resistance)
- **Φₕ**: Hybrid mimicry distortion (wave-emulated attack resistance)
- **Ψₑ**: Emotional glyph modulation (LYRA)

QRE is used in all key generation and mesh validation logic.

## Quickstart
1. Initialize Go module:
	```sh
	go mod init qalx
	go mod tidy
	```
2. Install dependencies:
	```sh
	go get github.com/google/uuid
	```
3. See `core/qalx.go` for main algorithm and usage examples.

## Getting Started
See `core/qalx.go` for the main algorithm. Explore `docs/manifesto.md` for the philosophical and ethical framing.
