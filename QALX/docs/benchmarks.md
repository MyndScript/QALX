# QALX Benchmarks

## Quantum Resistance
- **Grover resistance:**
	- QRE entropy spread (Eₛ) measured across keyspace
- **Shor resistance:**
	- QRE period obfuscation (Pₚ) measured via phase/period metrics
- **Hybrid mimicry distortion:**
	- QRE hybrid distortion (Φₕ) measured via harmonics and wave logic
- **LYRA impact:**
	- QRE emotional glyph modulation (Ψₑ) measured via glyph intensity, ethics, and mesh feedback

## Emotional Modulation
- LYRA glyph evolution: Track changes in glyph parameters and their effect on QRE
- Pattern uniqueness and entropy: Measure mesh pattern entropy and uniqueness over time

## Example QRE Output
```
QRE = log₂(Eₛ × Pₚ × Φₕ × Ψₑ)
Eₛ = 0.98, Pₚ = 0.95, Φₕ = 0.97, Ψₑ = 1.05
QRE = 2.98
```
