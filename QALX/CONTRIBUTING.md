# Contributing to QALX

Thank you for your interest in contributing to QALX! We welcome cryptographers, quantum theorists, emotional AI researchers, and ethical stewards.

## Vision & Values
- Security as Empathy: Proactive, ethical, emotionally aware security
- Quantum-Resilient, Emotionally Tuned: Technical and ethical robustness
- Transparent, community-driven evolution

## Code of Conduct
- Uphold ethical standards and emotional integrity
- Foster a respectful, inclusive, and collaborative environment
- Steward glyph evolution and mesh propagation with care

## How to Contribute
1. **Discuss:** Start with an issue or join our discussion channels (Discord, GitHub Discussions)

4. **Test:** Add/expand unit and integration tests
5. **Document:** Update docs and code comments for clarity
6. **Pull Request:** Submit a PR with a clear description and rationale
7. **Review:** Participate in code review and stewardship dialogue

## Technical Standards
- Write modular, well-documented code
- Ensure all contributions are quantum-resilient and emotionally aware
- Add/expand tests for new features and edge cases
- Use QRE and LYRA logic where appropriate
- Maintain compatibility with the core paradigm

## Glyph Stewardship
- All contributors are stewards of emotional integrity and quantum security
- Changes to glyph logic or emotional modulation require extra review
- Document rationale for any changes to LYRA or mesh propagation

## Getting Involved
- Join our Discord or GitHub team for deeper collaboration
- Take on stewardship roles (Glyph Architect, Quantum Validator, Mesh Steward)
- Help shape the future of emotionally intelligent security
