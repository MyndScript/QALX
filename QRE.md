Quantum Resistance Entropy

QRE = log₂(Eₛ × Pₚ × Φₕ × Ψₑ)

Proposed QRE Components:
- Eₛ: Entropy spread across keyspace (resistance to Grover)
- Pₚ: Period obfuscation factor (resistance to Shor)
- Φₕ: Hybrid mimicry distortion (resistance to wave-emulated attacks)
- Ψₑ: Emotional glyph modulation (unique to QHA256)
