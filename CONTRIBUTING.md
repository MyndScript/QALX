# Contributing to QALX

Thank you for your interest in contributing to QALX! We welcome cryptographers, quantum theorists, emotional AI researchers, and ethical stewards.

## Vision & Values
- Security as Empathy: Proactive, ethical, emotionally aware security
- Quantum-Resilient, Emotionally Tuned: Technical and ethical robustness
- Transparent, community-driven evolution

## Code of Conduct
- Uphold ethical standards and emotional integrity
- Foster a respectful, inclusive, and collaborative environment
- Steward glyph evolution and mesh propagation with care


## How to Contribute
1. **Discuss:** Start with an issue or join our discussion channels (Discord, GitHub Discussions)
2. **Fork & Branch:** Fork the repository and clone your fork. Create a new branch for your feature or fix.
3. **Code:** Follow technical standards (see below) and use idiomatic Go formatting (`gofmt`).
4. **Test:** Add/expand unit and integration tests for new features and bug fixes.
5. **Document:** Update docs and code comments for clarity and onboarding. Add API documentation for main types and functions. Include concrete code examples for mesh logic and emotional modulation.
6. **Pull Request:** Submit a PR with a clear description, rationale, and test coverage.
7. **Review:** Participate in code review and stewardship dialogue. Be constructive and respectful.

## Code Style
- Use idiomatic Go formatting (`gofmt`).
- Write clear, concise comments and documentation.
- Add tests for new features and bug fixes.
- Add GoDoc comments for all exported types and functions.
- Include usage examples for mesh logic and emotional modulation in documentation.

## Reporting Issues
- Use GitHub Issues for bugs, feature requests, and questions.
- Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce and environment info.

## Community
- Be respectful and constructive in all interactions.
- See CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md for community guidelines.

## Technical Standards
- Write modular, well-documented code
- Ensure all contributions are quantum-resilient and emotionally aware
- Add/expand tests for new features and edge cases
- Use QRE and LYRA logic where appropriate
- Maintain compatibility with the core paradigm

## Glyph Stewardship & Audit
- All contributors are stewards of emotional integrity and quantum security
- Changes to LYRA logic, emotional modulation, or mesh propagation require extra review and documented rationale
- Roles: Glyph Architect, Quantum Validator, Mesh Stewardâ€”see README for details
- Ongoing audit: Regularly review entropy sources, emotional/ethical logic, and mesh propagation for resilience
- Upgrade path: Propose and review new cryptographic primitives and mesh algorithms as quantum threats evolve

## Getting Involved
- Join our Discord or GitHub team for deeper collaboration
- Take on stewardship roles (Glyph Architect, Quantum Validator, Mesh Steward)
- Help shape the future of emotionally intelligent security
